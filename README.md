2. First you need to authenticate yourself using the endpoint **/authenticate**
   * For this purpose use one of the hardcoded credentials listed below
   * In return you will get **access token** (jwtToken)
3. Copy the returned access token, click the **Authorize** button on the top of the right side and paste it there
4. Now you can use all the other endpoints and the access token is automatically sent in the HTTP headers in each request
